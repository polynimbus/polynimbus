## Overview

Polynimbus is a multi-cloud infrastructure management tool, designed to increase work efficiency with many separate cloud environments. It is composed from 4 subprojects:

 1. [**Polynimbus API**](docs/api.md) - consistent command line API to manage server instances during their full lifecycle, from launching and software provisioning, through normal operation, until decommissioning.
 2. [**Polynimbus Inventory**](docs/inventory.md) - crawler that analyzes resources (servers, databases, storage, domains, serverless objects etc.) created on all configured cloud accounts, and prepares an inventory, that can be used by eg. Polynimbus Panel.
 3. [**Polynimbus Panel**](https://github.com/polynimbus/polynimbus-panel) - clean and simple web panel, showing all servers, databases, storage, domains, serverless objects etc., created across all configured cloud accounts. Using this panel, you can avoid over 90% of switching your browser between accounts during typical DevOps/SRE work and dramatically increase your productivity. Provided as separate repository for security reason.
 4. [**Polynimbus Backup**](https://github.com/polynimbus/polynimbus-backup) - fully automatic local backup for object storage. Provided as separate repository, to allow installing Backup subproject on separate storage hardware, with minimal dependencies.

## Why Polynimbus?

Polynimbus API hides all semantic differences between all supported cloud vendors, so you can eg. create your own server deployment scheme, and then easily shift your infrastructure betweens many vendors, accounts, pricing plans, promotions etc. to reduce your cloud bills.

Included web panel allows you to work efficiently with many cloud accounts, belonging to many different organizations (which is not possible using eg. AWS Organizations). You no longer need to log in to another cloud account each time you want just to check eg. configuration details of some server, or if particular database, storage bucket, Lambda function etc. is already created or not. 

## Installation

Polynimbus has to be installed exactly into `/opt/polynimbus` directory. Basic installation is just:
```
git clone https://github.com/polynimbus/polynimbus /opt/polynimbus
/opt/polynimbus/install.sh
```
This script will guide you through installation of required software dependencies. See [API documentation](docs/api.md) for usage examples.
